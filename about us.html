          <p>The concept of aura has a rich history spanning multiple cultures, philosophies, and spiritual traditions.
            The term generally refers to an energy field surrounding living beings, often depicted as a luminous glow or
            colored halo. Ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians, Hindus, and Chinese, believed in the existence
            of an unseen life force, often linked to health, emotions, and spirituality. In Hinduism and Buddhism, the
            aura is connected to the chakras, or energy centers, influencing physical and mental well-being.

            In Western mysticism, auras gained attention in the 19th and 20th centuries through Theosophy and
            Spiritualism, with figures like Helena Blavatsky and Charles Leadbeater describing it as a reflection of
            oneâ€™s inner state.</p>
